# Homework: Paint Estimator


## The Problem


The big-box hardware store *House Depot* has contracted you to write an App to estimate the amount of paint required to paint a room. Given that 1 gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, you must output the number of 1 gallon paint cans required to paint a rectangular room.

The program should input:

- the length of the room in feet, 
- the width of the room in feet,
- the height of the room in feet,
- number of coats of paint (how many times will you go over the walls? 1, 2, 3, etc...)

The program should output:

- total area to be painted (sum of each of the 4 walls, multiplied by the height of the room)
- the number of gallons required to paint the room with the number of coats of paint.

Example 1:

```
Enter length of room: 12
Enter width of room: 14
Enter height of room: 8
Enter number of coats: 2
Total area to be painted: 416.00 sqft
2 Coats requires: 832.00 sqft
1 Can of paint covers 400 sqft
Total gallons of paint requried for 2 coats is : 3 cans
```

Example 2:

```
Enter length of room: 2
Enter width of room: 4
Enter height of room: 10
Enter number of coats: 3
Total area to be painted: 120.00 sqft
3 Coats requires: 360.00 sqft
1 Can of paint covers 400 sqft
Total gallons of paint requried for 3 coats is : 1 cans
```

HINTS: 

- Follow the same problem solving approaches from small group: Understanding the problem by example.
- Round up to the nearest whole can of paint.
- Code exactly one of the examples then change to accept inputs.



## Part 1: Problem Analysis


### 1.1 Program Outputs

Write out your story in the cell below, place `{}` around the variables (things that will change in your mad-libs story). Make sure you have **at least 5 variables** and at **least two sentences in your story.**




### 1.2 Program Inputs

List out the program inputs in the cell below. What will you allow the person using your mad-lib to type as they create the story? There should be the same number of inputs as variables in your story.




### 1.3 The Plan (Algorithm)

Explain, as specifically as you can, without writing code, how the program works from input to output. Be detailed with your plan as you will need to turn it into code. 




## Part 2: Code Solution

You may write your code in several cells, but place the complete, final working copy of your code solution within the cell labeled `# SOLUTION CELL` everything required to make the code work should be in this cell, as this is the cell that will get evaluated. 

### 2.1 You Code

Place your working code in the cell below. Execution of this one cell is all that should be necessary to execute the code correctly.


```python
# SOLUTION CELL

```
